"""Last-date resolvers for the weaving planning grid.

Clone of ``beaming_standards.py`` for the Weaving section (CONTRACT §3). These
helpers resolve the time-versioned QUALITY-linked standard/target/actual params
that feed the per-loom-per-quality planning grid. They are pure data-access
functions: each accepts an open SQLAlchemy ``Session`` and returns plain floats
so the formula layer (``weaving_rules.py``) stays DB-agnostic.

Resolution rules:
  * resolve_param              -> jute_prod_weaving_target_map row with
                                  MAX(effective_date) <= on_date for
                                  (co_id, ref_id, id_type, value_role, param,
                                  active=1). Branch-agnostic.
  * resolve_quality_standards  -> the per-(machine, quality) bundle resolved through
                                  resolve_param across BOTH dimensions (LOCKED
                                  CONTRACT, mirroring beaming). Weaving is
                                  TWO-DIMENSIONAL:
                                    MACHINE-linked (id_type='mcid', ref_id=machine_id,
                                    a LOOM): speed -> standard/target/actual.
                                    QUALITY-linked (id_type='qid',
                                    ref_id=weaving_quality_id): picks -> standard;
                                    eff -> standard/target; actual picks come from
                                    vw_weaving_pick_act (resolve_act_picks), NOT the
                                    target map.
                                  plus the COALESCE eff_speed/eff_picks the rules +
