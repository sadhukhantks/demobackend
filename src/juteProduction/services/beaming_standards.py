"""Last-date resolvers for the beaming planning grid.

Mirrors ``spinning_standards.py`` for the Beaming section (SPEC §B.6 / §2).
These helpers resolve the time-versioned machine-linked standard/target params
that feed the per-machine-per-quality planning grid. They are pure data-access
functions: each accepts an open SQLAlchemy ``Session`` and returns plain floats
so the formula layer (``beaming_rules.py``) stays DB-agnostic.

Resolution rules:
  * resolve_param              -> jute_prod_beaming_target_map row with
                                  MAX(effective_date) <= on_date for
                                  (co_id, ref_id, id_type, value_role, param,
                                  active=1). Branch-agnostic.
  * resolve_machine_standards  -> the per-(machine, quality) bundle resolved
                                  through resolve_param across BOTH dimensions

                                  (ref_id=machine_id), while the QUALITY-linked
                                  params (laid_length/cuts_per_beam/eff) key off
                                  id_type='qid' (ref_id=bm_quality_id).

    Each value is a LAST-DATE resolution (newest effective_date <= on_date),
    branch-agnostic, defaulting to 0.0 when absent. The returned KEYS are unchanged
    (laid_length, cuts_per_beam, std_speed, target_speed, std_eff, target_eff, dia,
    act_rpm) so the entry/compute callers need no shape change — only the linkage of
    where each value is read from. ``bm_quality_id`` may be None/0 (e.g. the prefill
    endpoint asking for machine-only params) — the qid params then resolve to 0.0.

    SPEED MODEL (locked contract): the resolved 'speed' params are RPMs
    (rotations/min), NOT surface speeds. So ``std_speed`` and ``target_speed``
    here are RPM values, and ``act_rpm`` is the actual RPM resolved from
    value_role='actual' (entered via the Beaming SQC page; 0.0 until entered).
    Surface speed (yd/min) = rpm × dia × π / 36 is computed downstream in
    ``beaming_rules`` (use ``beaming_rules.act_speed(rpm, dia)`` for the
    std / target / actual surface speeds). ``act_rpm`` = mcid / actual / speed.
