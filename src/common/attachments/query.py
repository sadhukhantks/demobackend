"""Raw SQL helpers for the file_attachment table and source-table back-refs.

All callable functions return SQLAlchemy `text()` objects with named bind
parameters. The dynamic-column helpers (`update_jute_mr_attachment_col`,
`clear_jute_mr_attachment_col`) accept a *pre-validated* column name —
the router resolves this via the `MODULE_COLUMN_MAP` allow-list in
constants.py, so no user input ever reaches an interpolated SQL string.
