# Jute SQC — VOW Rollout Spec

Moving the **Empire Jute Mill "Daily SQC"** Google-Sheet system (reports **R-08-01 … R-08-28** +
humidity) into the VOW ERP `juteSQC` module so the whole quality-control desk runs from VOW, with
the standard parameters (machine lists, qualities, std weights/CV bands) made **dynamic/configurable**
and the inputs **linked to existing masters**.

> This folder is the **spec** (design + plan), not the implementation. It tells a developer exactly
> what each unbuilt report needs: inputs, formulas, constants, the data model, the masters to link,
> the entry/report pages, and the open decisions.

## How this folder is organised

**Start here → `04-page-wiring.md`** (per page: what it does · inputs · outputs · which master to link).

> **Scope:** all ~28 reports at full depth (unbuilt + already-built, as-built). **Owner refinements:**
> (1) **Standards** live in a **satellite table linked by `item_id`** (like `jute_yarn_mst`), reused or
> created per stage — **case-by-case**, see `05-standards-storage.md`; exact tables decided in
> discussion (`▶ standards: later`). (2) **Entry UX** = **tabbed pages per stage**, entry tabs built
> **responsive** for mobile/tablet. (3) **Linkages** = keep what's already linked, defer the rest.

| File | What it covers |
|------|----------------|
| `INDEX.md` | This file — map + report inventory + status |
| `04-page-wiring.md` | ⭐ **Start here** — per-page wiring: does / inputs / outputs / master links |
| `05-standards-storage.md` | The agreed standards approach: `item_id`-keyed satellite tables, case-by-case |
| `00-overview-and-architecture.md` | How the Google system works today, the VOW target, the decisions |
| `01-standards-and-formulas.md` | The cross-cutting jute-SQC math (the report *outputs*): MR correction, count conversion, CV%, buckets/flags (verified) |
| `02-linking-map.md` | What links to what — every report's lists → existing VOW masters; Phase-2 production links |
| `03-setup-guide.md` | How to build it: phasing, migrations, tabbed responsive pages, menu, tests |
| `reports/*.md` | One detailed spec per report (inputs, formulas, model, endpoints, pages, worked example) |

## Report inventory & status

Process flow (jute mill): **Selection → Batching/Softening → Carding → Drawing → Spinning → Winding/Beaming → Weaving → Finishing/Packing.**

## Source-of-truth note

The master Google workbook is **"Daily Summary Date Select"** (`1aUETk61DagSSHnI0bOsl_AM9R8bxXw6RPE-BRlAVY-Q`).
It is a **date-driven view** that `IMPORTRANGE`s from per-report **DSR source workbooks** (the real
entry sheets + formulas). Those DSR workbooks are **not shared** with us, so this spec is built from
the **cached computed values inside the master tabs** (real entries dated 05/01/2026), the two shared
response sheets (Morrah, R-08-15), and the already-built VOW reference code. Anything not 100%
confirmable from cached values is flagged in `05-open-questions.md`.
