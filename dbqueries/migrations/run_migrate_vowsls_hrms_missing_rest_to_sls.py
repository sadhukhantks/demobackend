Migrate ALL remaining emp_code-missing HRMS employees (companies 1 and 2) from vowsls to sls.

Final step of the vowsls->sls HRMS series (smallco 2026-07-27, co65 + co67/106/139 2026-07-28).
Requested 2026-07-28: "EJCL486 is not migrated, migrate all emp_codes which are missing".

SCOPE — an employee is in scope iff:
  - personal.company_id IN (1, 2), AND
  - they have at least one official row with a non-empty emp_code, AND
  - NONE of their trimmed emp_codes already exist in sls.hrms_ed_official_details.
(~8,240: 8,231 co-2 EJM historicals + 9 co-1.)

Verified pre-flight (2026-07-28):
  - ALL 8,231 co-2 scope employees already have sls personal rows with the SAME eb_id and
    matching first name (earlier EJM migration copied personal for everyone but official/child
    rows only for others) -> identity map, personal NOT re-inserted.
    ~81 active co-2 employees are PARTIALLY migrated (some addr/bank/contact/esi/pf/resign rows
    exist) -> per-table eb-level guards skip ebs that already have rows in that table.
  - The 9 co-1 employees collide: their sls eb slot holds a DIFFERENT person (name mismatch)
    -> remapped to fresh eb_ids, personal inserted.
  - masters: 1 dept, 3 designation (+2 attendance-only), 1 category absent -> created, legacy
    ids preserved. Leave types all present; leave txn ids collision-free.
  - 2 co-2 employees have official.branch_id = 0 -> branch falls back to their sls personal
    branch (29). Attendance: 89 sls rows pre-exist for scope ebs -> INSERT IGNORE dedups.

Collision rule (differs from smallco): a map row is remapped to a fresh eb_id ONLY when the sls
personal row at that eb has a DIFFERENT first name; same-name rows are identity-mapped.
Personal is inserted only for map rows whose new_eb_id is absent from sls personal.
